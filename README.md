# Eye Excercise
The Eye Movement Excercise is a fun and interactive web application that demonstrates how eye movements can be controlled through user input. The application features a pair of animated eyes that follow the movement of the user's mouse cursor. You can pause and resume the eye movement at any time using the "Stop" button.
